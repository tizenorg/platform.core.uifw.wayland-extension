  <interface name="wl_keyrouter" version="1">
    <description summary="an interface to set each focus for each key">
      In tradition, all the keys in a keyboard and a device on which
      some keys are attached will be sent to focus surface by default.
      Currently it's possible to set up each focus for each key in a keyboard and a device.
      Therefore, by setting a key grab for a surface, the owner of the
      surface will get the key event when it has the key grab for the key.
